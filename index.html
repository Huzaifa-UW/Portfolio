          <h2>About me</h2>
          <p> <strong> Hi, I’m Huzaifa. </strong> I’m a Computer Science student who learns by building things and figuring out how they work. I enjoy solving problems, experimenting, and slowly improving my skills with every project I try.

I don’t focus on being an “expert”—I just try to get a little better every day. Along the way, I’ve picked up programming, problem-solving, and logical thinking in a way that feels natural.

When I’m not coding, I like playing games, reading books, learning new things, helping people around me, and just enjoying life. My goal is simple: keep learning, keep building, and make work that actually matters.</p>
